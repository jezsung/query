Flutter Query is a powerful data fetching and state management library for Flutter, inspired by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) (formerly React Query). It provides a declarative, hooks-based API for managing asynchronous state in your Flutter applications.

## Features

- **Declarative Data Fetching** - Fetch data with simple hooks that handle loading, error, and success states automatically
- **Automatic Caching** - Query results are cached and shared across your app
- **Smart Refetching** - Configurable background refetching on mount, app resume, or at intervals
- **Request Deduplication** - Multiple components requesting the same data share a single request
- **Automatic Retries** - Failed requests are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Mutations with Callbacks** - Create, update, and delete data with lifecycle callbacks
- **Optimistic Updates** - Update the UI optimistically before the server responds
- **Query Invalidation** - Invalidate and refetch queries when data changes
- **Garbage Collection** - Unused cached data is automatically cleaned up

## Why Flutter Query?

Managing server state in Flutter applications can be complex. You need to handle:

- Loading and error states
- Caching and cache invalidation
- Background updates and refetching
- Request deduplication
- Retry logic
- Optimistic updates

Flutter Query solves all of these problems with a simple, declarative API that lets you focus on building your UI.
