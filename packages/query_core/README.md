# Query Core

**Note: This package is no longer actively maintained.**

This package was originally created as a Dart-only core that the `flutter_query` package would depend on. The two packages were split to provide pure Dart code separate from Flutter-specific functionality.

However, since the Dart programming language is almost exclusively used in the Flutter ecosystem and the usage of the `query_core` package doesn't really align with other non-Flutter Dart use cases, this package won't be developed any further.

**All files from this package have been copied directly into the `flutter_query` package.** The `flutter_query` package no longer depends on `query_core` for easier maintenance and development.
